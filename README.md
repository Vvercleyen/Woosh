## little explanation

I mainly focused on getting the frontend visuals correct according to this design https://xd.adobe.com/view/7b76f3be-3349-4c0b-bf74-03fc7f69d3b5-2e25/specs/
I didn't invest a lot of time in architecture optimization since I think this wasn't the essence of the task.
If I would have invested more time in this I would have, for example, Implemented lazy loading by using multiple modules that only load when neeeded.
